# E-Commerce RESTful API

## Description

This project is a RESTful API built with Flask for managing products in an e-commerce application. It provides endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting products. The API persists product data in a MongoDB database and includes proper error handling and documentation for the endpoints.
